<p>Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated 
perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory. AR can be defined as
a system that fulfills three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real 
objects. The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural 
environment). This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment. 
In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world 
environment with a simulated one. Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms: mixed reality and computer-mediated reality.</p> 
<p>The primary value of augmented reality is the manner in which components of the digital world blend into a person's perception of the real world, not as a 
simple display of data, but through the integration of immersive sensations, which are perceived as natural parts of an environment. The earliest functional
AR systems that provided immersive mixed reality experiences for users were invented in the early 1990s, starting with the Virtual Fixtures system developed
at the U.S. Air Force's Armstrong Laboratory in 1992. Commercial augmented reality experiences were first introduced in entertainment and gaming
businesses. Subsequently, augmented reality applications have spanned commercial industries such as education, communications, medicine, and entertainment.
In education, content may be accessed by scanning or viewing an image with a mobile device or by using markerless AR techniques.</p>
<p>Augmented reality is used to enhance natural environments or situations and offer perceptually enriched experiences. With the help of advanced AR technologies
(e.g. adding computer vision, incorporating AR cameras into smartphone applications and object recognition) the information about the surrounding real world
of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulated. Information about the environment and its objects is overlaid on the real world. This information
can be virtual or real, e.g. seeing other real sensed or measured information such as electromagnetic radio waves overlaid in exact alignment
with where they actually are in space. Augmented reality also has a lot of potential in the gathering and sharing of tacit knowledge. Augmentation
techniques are typically performed in real time and in semantic contexts with environmental elements. Immersive perceptual information is sometimes combined
with supplemental information like scores over a live video feed of a sporting event. This combines the benefits of both augmented reality technology and heads
up display technology (HUD).</p> 
<p>Augmented reality (AR) is one of the biggest technology trends right now, and it’s only going to get bigger as AR ready smartphones and other devices become
more accessible around the world. AR let us see the real-life environment right in front of us—trees swaying in the park, dogs chasing balls, kids playing 
soccer—with a digital augmentation overlaid on it. For example,  a pterodactyl might be seen landing in the trees, the dogs could be mingling with their 
cartoon counterparts, and the kids could be seen kicking past an alien spacecraft on their way to score a goal.</p>  
<p>With advances in AR technology, these examples are not that different from what might already be available for your smartphone. Augmented reality is, in fact,
readily available and being used in a myriad of ways including as Snapchat lenses, in apps that help you find your car in a crowded parking lot, and in variety
of shopping apps that let you try on clothes without even leaving home.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous example of AR technology is the mobile app Pokemon Go, which was released in 2016 and quickly became an inescapable sensation. In the 
game, players locate and capture Pokemon characters that pop up in the real world—on your sidewalk, in a fountain, even in your own bathroom.</p>
