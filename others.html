<h6> Nanotechnology</h6>
<p>The ideas and concepts behind nanoscience and nanotechnology started with a talk entitled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” by physicist Richard Feynman
at an American Physical Society meeting at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) on December 29, 1959, long before the term nanotechnology was used.
In his talk, Feynman described a process in which scientists would be able to manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules. Over a decade later, in his
explorations of ultraprecision machining, Professor Norio Taniguchi coined the term nanotechnology. It wasn't until 1981, with the development of the scanning 
tunneling microscope that could "see" individual atoms, that modern nanotechnology began.</p>
<p>Nanotechnology is the understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale, at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers, where unique phenomena
enable novel applications. Encompassing nanoscale science, engineering, and technology, nanotechnology involves imaging, measuring, modeling, and manipulating
matter at this length scale. Matter such as gases, liquids, and solids can exhibit unusual physical, chemical, and biological properties at the nanoscale, 
differing in important ways from the properties of bulk materials and single atoms or molecules. Some nanostructured materials are stronger or have different 
magnetic properties compared to other forms or sizes of the same material. Others are better at conducting heat or electricity. They may become more chemically 
reactive or reflect light better or change color as their size or structure is altered.</p>

<h4>Biotechnology</h4>
<p>Biotechnology is a broad area of biology, involving the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products. Depending on the tools and applications,
it often overlaps with related scientific fields. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, biotechnology has expanded to include new and diverse sciences, 
such as genomics, recombinant gene techniques, applied immunology, and development of pharmaceutical therapies and diagnostic tests. The term biotechnology was
first used by Karl Ereky in 1919, meaning the production of products from raw materials with the aid of living organisms.</p>
<p>The wide concept of biotechnology encompasses a wide range of procedures for modifying living organisms according to human purposes, going back to domestication
of animals, cultivation of the plants, and "improvements" to these through breeding programs that employ artificial selection and hybridization. Modern usage 
also includes genetic engineering as well as cell and tissue culture technologies. The American Chemical Society defines biotechnology as the application of 
biological organisms, systems, or processes by various industries to learning about the science of life and the improvement of the value of materials and 
organisms such as pharmaceuticals, crops, and livestock. Per the European Federation of Biotechnology, biotechnology is the integration of natural science
and organisms, cells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues for products and services. Biotechnology is based on the basic biological sciences 
(e.g. molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, embryology, genetics, microbiology) and conversely provides methods to support and perform basic 
research in biology.</p>
