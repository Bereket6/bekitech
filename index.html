<p>Our ancestors could only dream of. And yet, nagging doubts remain that technology is taking over our lives. 
One question remains: Is a hi-tech society delivering all it promised?
Technology is hugely important to our lives. Love it or loathe it, technology affects almost everything we do today and it also
influences most of our plans for the future. Whether we experience the benefits of a hearing aid or a hearing implant, use a mobile phone,
listen to music and radio, surf the internet for news or turn the GPS on in our car,
we are constantly enjoying the benefits of a hi-tech life. 
Technology  is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in
the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes,
and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines)
applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as
technology systems or technological systems.
</p>

<p>The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later 
Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their 
environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical 
barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.
</p>

<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of 
a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment
of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. 
Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.
</p>

<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or 
worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it 
harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued 
technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.

<h3 style="font-size: xx-large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Emerging Technlogy </h3>
<p>Emerging technologies are technologies whose development, practical applications, or both are still largely unrealized, such that they 
are figuratively emerging into prominence from a background of nonexistence or obscurity. These technologies are new, such as various 
applications of biotechnology including gene therapy. Emerging technologies are often perceived as capable of changing the status quo.
</p>

<p>Emerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty (in application even if not in origins), relatively fast growth, 
coherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and ambiguity. In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as "a radically 
novel and<IMG SRC="images/111.jpg" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="5" VSPACE="5" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"/> relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the 
potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors,
institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes. Its most prominent
impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous."Emerging digital technologies
 have generated new opportunities while creating new legal challenges, particularly related to copyrights, trademarks, patents, royalties, and 
 licensing. For example, the development of new digital communication technologies and media has given rise to novel issues relating to the digital 
 reproduction and distribution of copyrighted works. The federal government, affected industries, and groups advocating for the public interest have 
 taken (and continue to take) action to craft appropriate protections and offer legal certainty to copyright owners, digital technology companies, 
 the public, and other interested parties.
